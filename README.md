Bass Broker: Stock Monitoring Application
Overview
Bass Broker is a real-time stock monitoring application for Android that provides audio cues for stock price movements. This personal project transforms financial data tracking into an auditory experience where different bass sounds correspond to stock market events, allowing users to passively monitor their portfolios while focusing on other tasks.
Technologies & Architecture

Kotlin with Coroutines for asynchronous operations
Jetpack Compose for modern declarative UI
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture with unidirectional data flow
Retrofit2 for REST API communications
DataStore for persistent preferences storage
Canvas API for custom financial chart visualization
Android WorkManager for background processing
ThreeTenABP for advanced date-time handling
Foreground Service implementation for continuous monitoring

Core Features

Real-time stock price monitoring via Yahoo Finance API
Historical price data visualization with interactive charts
Custom high/low price threshold alerts with sound notifications
Configurable sound profiles for different market conditions
Background monitoring that persists across app restarts
Price prediction with confidence intervals for forward-looking analysis

Technical Implementation Highlights

API Integration: Implemented a robust repository pattern to handle API responses with Kotlin's Result type for elegant error handling
Background Processing: Utilized WorkManager to schedule periodic stock price checks to minimize battery consumption
Reactive UI: Employed StateFlow for reactive UI updates based on real-time data changes
Sound Pattern Recognition: Developed algorithms to detect market patterns (breakouts, breakdowns, trends) and trigger corresponding audio signals
Fallback Mechanisms: Implemented graceful fallbacks for handling network disruptions and API limitations
Predictive Analytics: Created a statistical prediction model to forecast price movements with visual confidence intervals

Advanced Prediction System

Time-Series Forecasting: Implemented a custom statistical model to predict future price movements
Statistical Analysis: Uses weighted trend calculation, volatility assessment, and momentum indicators
Confidence Visualization: Provides visual representation of prediction confidence as shaded areas
Audio Feedback: Different bass tones indicate prediction strength and direction
Adaptive Intervals: Confidence intervals automatically adjust based on historical volatility

Performance Considerations

Optimized API calls using a 5-day range to obtain accurate historical data while minimizing request frequency
Implemented efficient data transformation pipelines to process financial timeseries
Used sparse arrays for handling time-series data to minimize memory footprint
Designed lightweight prediction algorithms for on-device processing without external dependencies

Future Enhancements

Integration with additional financial data sources
Advanced pattern recognition for technical analysis indicators
Enhanced machine learning models for more accurate price predictions
Customizable widget for home screen monitoring

Note
This is a personal project developed to track a small set of securities in my investment portfolio. The application is not intended for commercial use and is primarily a showcase of technical skills in Android development, real-time data processing, and user experience design.
